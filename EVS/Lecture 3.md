# Atmosphere
- Mix of gases ($N_{2}$, $CO_{2}$, $CO$, $SO_{x}$, $NO_{x} \ \dots$) + Dust particles + Water-Droplets+ Subatomic Particles
- It is an abiotic component.

It is the mixture of various gases, water-vapors, and subatomic particles that entirely covers the earth, extending outward several thousand kilometers.

## Layers of Atmosphere: 

![[EVS-L4.1.excalidraw]]

### Troposphere
- Lower portion of the atmosphere
- Extends up to 8 Km at the poles and 16 km at the equator, on an average it extends up to 10-11 Km form the Earth's surface.
- Temperature decreases at the rate of 5-7$\degree \text{C}$ per Km. 
### Stratosphere
- 2nd layer of Atmosphere. Lies above the Troposphere.
- 50-55 Km above the Earth's Surface
- Ozone layer exists in in the Stratosphere.
- Temperature remains constant for 20Km, then starts increasing

### Mesosphere
- 3rd layer of the Atmosphere 
- Lies at 80 Km above the Earth's Surface.
- Temperature $\downarrow$es slightly, then rapidly with height (-75$\degree C$) 
### Thermosphere
- Temperature increases rapidly with increase on height
- Heating of this layer is due to the absorption of solar energy.
- Within the thermosphere there is a layer of charged particles known as **ionosphere**.

### Exosphere
- It exists above the ionosphere and extends up to 2000Km above the Earth's Surface.
- This layer is almost a vacuum.
- Very high temperature. ($\geq12000\degree C$ )
