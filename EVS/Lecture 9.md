## Nuclear Fission
$$
_{92}U^{235} + \  _{0}n^{1}\longrightarrow \ _{36}Kr^{92} + \ _{56}Ba^{141} + 3 _{0}n^{1}+ \text{Energy}
$$
Heavy nuclei split to form various lighter nuclei.

## Nuclear Fusion
Multiple small nuclei *fuse* together to form a heavier nuclei
$$
_{1}H^{1} + \ _{1}H^{2} \longrightarrow \ _{2}He^{3}+ \ _{0}n^{1}+ \text{Energy}
$$
