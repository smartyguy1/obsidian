# Need for Public Awareness

We are responsible for depletion of natural resources, degradation of life supporting systems, Ecological imbalance, Polluted environment etc. Solid waste management, Oil pollution, Water pollution, air pollution, Smog, Bhopal Gas Tragedy, *Itai-Itai* Disease, Minamata Bay etc. are examples that threaten our survival. To get rid of these problems, environmental awareness is necessary. 
To protect the Environment, we should do the following,
1.  Preserve Forest Cover: We should minimize cutting of trees, 
2. Preserve Natural Resources
	1. We should not unnecessarily extract natural resources, such as Mineral resources, water resources etc.
3. Conserve Energy: We should not use too much energy from burning of fossil fuels.
4. Practice Green Technology: Use green technology that incorporates:
	- Treatment of aerial emissions.
	- Treatment of waste water
	- Waste reduction
	- Use of unconventional energy resources.
5. Maintain Ecological balance

Itai-Itai DIsease: too much cadmium 
Minamata Bay: too much Mercury
