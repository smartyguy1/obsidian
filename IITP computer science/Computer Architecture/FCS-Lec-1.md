# Structure and Function
#### Structure
- The way in which components relate to each other.
##### Function
- The operation of individual components as part of the structure.
##### Hierarchical structure:
- Set of interrelated subsystems
- Hierarchical nature of complex systems is essential to both their design and their description
- Designer need only deal with a particular level of the system at a time
	- Concerned with structure and function at each level
#### Function
There  are four basic functions that a computer can perform:
###### 1. Data processing
Data may take a wide variety of forms and the range of processing requirements is broad.
###### 2. Data Storage
- Short-term
- Long-term
###### 3. Data movement
- **Input-Output(I/O)** - when data is received from or delivered to a device (peripheral) that is directly connected to the computer
- **Data communications** : When data is moved over long distances, to or from a remote device
###### 4. Control
- A control unit manages the computer's resources and orchestrates the performance of its functional parts in response to instructions.
