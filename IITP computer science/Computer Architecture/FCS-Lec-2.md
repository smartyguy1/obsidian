# Structural components of Computer
There are for main structural components of the computer
- **CPU** - controls the operations of the computer and performs its data processing functions. ^162ea8
- **main memory**-stores data
- **I/O**- mores data between the computer and its external environment.
- **System interconnection**- some mechanism provides for communication among CPU main memory, and I/O. It is done by the means of a **system bus** consisting of a number of conducting wires.

## CPU (central processing Unit)

^9b1de0

- Portion of the computer that fetches and executes instruction
- consists of an ALU, a control unit, and registers.
- referred to as a processors in a System with a single processing unit.

## Core
- An individual processing unit On a processor chip.
- May be equivalent in functionality to a CPU on a single- CPU system.
- specialised processing Units are also referred to as cores.

## Processor
- A physical piece of silica containing one or more cores.
- It is the computer component that interprets and executes instructions.
- Referred to as a *multicore processor* if it contains multiple cores.

- **Control Unit:** Controls the operation of the CPU and hence the computer ^58a908
- **Arithmetic and Logical Unit(ALU):** Performs the computer's data processing functions  ^442146
- **Registers**: Provides storage internal to the CPU
- **CPU interconnection:** Some mechanism that provides for communication among the control unit, ALU, and registers.(Internal Bus)
## Cache Memory
- Multiple layers of memory between the processor and main memory.
- Is smaller and foster than main memory.
- Used to speed up memory access by placing in the cache data from main memory that is likely to be used in the near futures.
- A greater performance improvement may be obtained by using multiple levels of cache with level 1 (L1) closest to the core and additional levels (L-2, L3,etc.) progressively farther from the core.
