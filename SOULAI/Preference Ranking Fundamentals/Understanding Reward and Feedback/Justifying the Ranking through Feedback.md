### Keep in mind the following when writing justification

1. ****Start with the chosen rating:**** Begin by clearly stating which response is better based on the Likert scale. __Example: "Response A is better than Response B because..."__
2. ****Evaluate both responses side by side:**** Identify the strengths of the better response and explain why it stands out.
3. ****Address affected criteria:**** Mention the relevant dimensions (e.g., Instruction Following, Factual Accuracy) and how they influenced the overall quality.
4. ****Provide suggestions for improvement:**** Offer specific, actionable changes that could improve the weaker response.
5. ****Mention expected outcome:**** Explain how the suggested improvements would enhance the user experience or align the model better with expectations.
