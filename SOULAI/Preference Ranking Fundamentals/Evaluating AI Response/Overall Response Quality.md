1. Overall Response Quality assesses how well the response performs as a whole in satisfying the user.
2. It evaluates the quality of the response by considering **all the dimensions together.**

## How to Approach

1. Scan previous dimension ratings.
2. Make a note of the number of issues.
3. Use the table below to select a rating from A–E.

| Rating           | Explanation                                                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **A – Amazing**  | The response **exceeded expectations** — it was highly satisfying, impressively clear, and well-phrased. The response has no issues.                                   |
| **B – Good**     | The response is **satisfactory** — reasonably clear, useful, and mostly correct. It has a few minor issues (1-2) but they **do not affect** the user’s overall intent. |
| **C – Okay**     | The response has **multiple minor issues** (>2) making it partially off-mark. These **do not affect the core intent**, but **refining is needed**.                     |
| **D – Bad**      | The response has one **major issue** that results in the user intent **not being satisfied completely**.                                                               |
| **E – Horrible** | The response has **multiple major issues** (>2), leaving the user dissatisfied. It may seem **confusing, off-topic, or unhelpful**.                                    |
