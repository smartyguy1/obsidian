### **How to Approach?**

When evaluating relevance:

1. Identify whether each part of the response directly supports the user’s intended goal or question.
2. If additional information like tips, considerations, and summaries are added, check if it is **clearly relevant to the user’s intent.**
3. Check if the model unnecessarily repeats information and flag it.

| No Issues    | Sure! Here are three effective ways to reduce screen time for kids under 10: <br>1. Set up screen-free zones and times – For example, no devices during meals or in bedrooms. This builds routines that reduce dependency. <br><br>2. Encourage non-digital hobbies – Offer options like art supplies, board games, or outdoor playtime to keep kids engaged away from screens. <br><br>3. Use parental controls – Many devices allow time limits or app restrictions. These tools help enforce healthy screen habits without constant negotiation. <br><br>These strategies are simple to implement and work well for younger children | • All suggestions are directly tailored to kids under 10. <br><br>• The tone, content, and focus match the prompt exactly. <br><br>• No tangents or irrelevant additions — high relevance and utility.                                                           |
| Minor Issues | You can try a few different strategies: • Introduce offline games and activities like puzzles or crafts. • Create a family schedule that limits screen time for everyone. • Consider discussing the risks of too much screen time, such as sleep issues or reduced focus. It’s also helpful for adults to reflect on their own screen habits, since kids often mimic parental behaviour. Adult screen addiction is a growing issue and can unconsciously influence children’s routines.                                                                                                                                                 | • The first part is relevant and reasonably helpful. <br><br>• But the ending shifts focus to adult behaviour, which isn’t part of the original prompt.<br><br>• It distracts from the intended audience (kids under 10), introducing mild but noticeable drift. |
| Major Issues | Screen time has become a major problem for today’s youth. Teenagers, in particular, are vulnerable to excessive screen use due to social media and video games. Studies show that tech overuse can lead to depression, poor sleep, and academic decline. Some experts recommend reviewing video game ratings to ensure age-appropriateness.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | • Entire focus is on teenagers, not children under 10.<br><br>• Discusses video game content and adolescent mental health — off-topic for both age and goal. <br><br>• Does not address the user’s request in any meaningful way.                                |
