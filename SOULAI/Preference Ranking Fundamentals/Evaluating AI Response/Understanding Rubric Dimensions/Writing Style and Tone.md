#### How to approach?

To assess Writing Style and Tone:

Check formatting: Are headings, paragraphs, bullet points, or other layout tools used to make the response visually appealing?

Check grammar, punctuation and syntax: Are sentences clear, correct, and easy to read without grammatical or structural errors?

#### Rating Categories & Explanation

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Rating|Criteria|
|No Issues|• The response is well-organised and written clearly making it easy to read and understand. The response is natural sounding. • The model uses the requested tone when specified in the prompt.|
|Minor Issues|• The response has minor inconsistencies in formatting, may include slightly awkward phrasing or occasional unnatural tone. • If tone was requested, the model attempts it but doesn't fully match the prompt’s intent.|
|Major Issues|• The response is poorly organised and formatted, making it difficult to read and understand. The response sounds unnatural, making it unengaging. • The response doesn’t align with the requested tone.|

| No Issues    | How Climate Change Affects Different Regions Differently Climate change does not impact all parts of the world equally. Here’s a regional breakdown: <br><br>1. Arctic and Polar Regions Experiencing the fastest warming due to ice-albedo feedback. Ice melt is disrupting ecosystems and indigenous lifestyles. <br>2. Small Island Nations Threatened by sea-level rise and saltwater intrusion. Vulnerable due to low elevation and limited resources. <br>3. Sub-Saharan Africa Facing severe droughts and agricultural decline. Food insecurity and climate migration are growing concerns. 4. Coastal Cities Worldwide Increased flooding and storm surges due to rising sea levels. Cities like Jakarta and Miami are already adapting infrastructure. <br>Conclusion Regional geography, socio-economic conditions, and adaptive capacity all influence how severely climate change is felt. | • Uses headings, bullets, section spacing, and numbered lists. <br><br>• Each idea is visually distinct and easy to scan.<br><br>• Great layout for a longer, multi-part explanation                                                                         |
| Minor Issues | • The Arctic is warming faster than any other place on Earth due to ice-albedo feedback. <br>• Small island nations face rising sea levels that threaten their very existence. <br>• Sub-Saharan Africa suffers from droughts, threatening food security.<br>• Coastal cities face flooding and infrastructure strain. While this list is regionally diverse, the effects share a common theme: climate vulnerability is closely tied to geography and economic resilience.`                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | • The response is still readable but there are no headings or subheadings to indicate each section of the response. <br><br>• The information presented as a bulleted list feels forced.

| Major Issues | Climate change is not evenly distributed across the globe as different regions experience different effects based on geographic location and resilience to environmental stress. The Arctic is warming at nearly twice the global rate which threatens ecosystems and ice-dependent communities. Meanwhile small island developing states are grappling with sea-level rise which could make them uninhabitable. Sub-Saharan Africa is facing increased droughts and erratic weather patterns that threaten food security. Coastal cities around the world like New York, Mumbai, and Jakarta are seeing higher flood risk. These variations are linked to local conditions but collectively reflect a global crisis of adaptation and preparedness.                                                                                                                                                   | • One big block containing multiple major ideas. <br><br>• No line breaks, no bullets, no visual cues. <br><br>• Fatiguing to read; visual overwhelm makes it hard to extract key points. <br><br>• Formatting clearly obstructs readability → Major Issues. |
