### **How to Approach?**

To assess completeness:

1. **Read the Prompt Carefully**
    
    Understand all explicit and implicit goals in the user's query. What are they asking, and what information would reasonably satisfy them?
    
2. **Check Completion**
    
    Ask yourself: Did the response address all parts of the question? Are any obvious elements missing?

| No Issues    | Blockchain is a decentralised, distributed ledger technology that records transactions across many computers so that the record cannot be altered retroactively without the alteration of all subsequent blocks and consensus of the network. Each block contains a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a cryptographic link to the previous block. Real-world example: Bitcoin uses blockchain to record cryptocurrency transactions. Every Bitcoin transfer is logged on the blockchain, making the system transparent and resistant to tampering without needing a central authority. For a deeper dive, you might find resources like the Bitcoin whitepaper or articles on supply chain blockchain applications useful. | The response covers the entire request thoroughly and adds contextual value.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Minor Issues | Blockchain is a system that records information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. It works as a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across an entire network of computer systems. Example: Bitcoin uses blockchain technology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 | • The blockchain concept is reasonably explained. • A real-world example is technically given ("Bitcoin"), but is barely elaborated — the user learns that Bitcoin uses blockchain but not how. • There’s no clarity on the real-world connection or mechanics, which the prompt implicitly asked for ("explain how and give example"). |
| Major Issues | Blockchain is a groundbreaking innovation that has influenced many industries by introducing a secure and transparent way of handling information. It is best known for its role in enabling cryptocurrencies, which have transformed the financial landscape in recent years. The concept of decentralised systems has inspired new ways of thinking about ownership, privacy, and security, challenging traditional centralised institutions. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, sectors like healthcare, logistics, and entertainment are exploring ways to incorporate it. Many experts believe blockchain will be a foundational technology for Web3 applications and the next generation of the internet.      | It sounds professional, but completely dodges the main goals: no mechanics explanation, no real-world illustration. → Major Issues                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
