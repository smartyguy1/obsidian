# Factual Accuracy Rating with Example

### **How to Approach?**

When evaluating for factual accuracy, follow this step-by-step method:

1. **Scan for Factual Claims**
    
    Identify statements that assert real-world truths, such as names, dates, figures, historical events, definitions, legal or scientific references.
    
2. **Verify Key Information**
    
    - Look for **cited sources or hyperlinks** in the response.
    - If no source is given, **use web search.**
    - Prefer **reputable sources** (e.g., academic papers, official websites, major publications).
