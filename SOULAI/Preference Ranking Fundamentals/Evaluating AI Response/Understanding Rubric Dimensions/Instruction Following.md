# Instruction Following Rating with Example

#### How to Approach?

When evaluating instruction following:

Focus on the Response

This parameter is not about factual accuracy or quality of content—it’s solely about whether the response followed the instructions.

Identify All Instructions

Evaluate the response point by point against this list.

Don’t penalize deviations in order unless the prompt specifically requires a sequence.

#### Rating Categories & Explanation

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Rating|What It Means|
|No Issues|All explicit and implicit instructions are followed precisely. The response fully aligns with the user’s task without omitting or altering instructions.|
|Minor Issues|Instructions are misinterpreted or partially followed, but the core of the task is still fulfilled.|
|Major Issues|The model disregards key instructions or misinterprets the prompt in a way that renders the output irrelevant or insufficient.|
|Not Applicable|Use this rating only when the prompt lacks any actual instructions (e.g., general conversation or statements that don’t expect action).|

#### Examples by Rating Category

| No Issues      | Climate change refers to long-term changes in the Earth’s weather patterns, mainly caused by human activities like burning fossil fuels. This releases gases that trap heat, warming the planet. As a result, we see rising temperatures, melting ice, and more extreme weather. For example, in 2023, Canada experienced record-breaking wildfires due to dry and hot conditions. These changes affect ecosystems, health, and economies worldwide. Slowing climate change means reducing pollution and switching to cleaner energy. Understanding the issue helps us make smarter choices for the future. | The response follows all explicit instructions: • Summary format • Simple language • Real-world example included • Approx. 100 words Implicit task format respected: educational tone, accessible structure.                                                                                      |
| Minor Issues   | Climate change is when the Earth’s temperature rises because of pollution from cars, factories, and electricity use. This causes weather to change in bad ways, like more storms or heat waves. It also harms animals and plants. People are working to fix this by using solar power or planting trees. For instance, many places are seeing longer summers now.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | • “many places are seeing longer summers now” is a very vague example. • The response is 65 words long, which is a deviation from the requested word count. • Core task is still fulfilled: The reader still gets a basic, understandable summary of climate change → Minor Issues                |
| Major Issues   | Climate change is a socio-environmental paradigm driven by anthropogenic forcing, notably post-industrial greenhouse emissions. Mitigation strategies require multilateral governance and geoengineering innovations, though implementation remains contentious in global South contexts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Fails all explicit instructions: • Not a summary — this is more of an academic commentary. • No real-world example included. • Language is highly technical, not simple (“anthropogenic forcing”, “geoengineering”).
