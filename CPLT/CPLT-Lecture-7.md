# Cyclic codes 
Cyclic codes are a special **error correcting codes** used to detect and connect errors in digital

They are a subset of **linear block codes** with a unique property that makes them particularly useful in various applications.

### Error Correcting Codes 
These are methods of adding redundancy to messages to detect and correct errors during transmission. 

### Linear Block Codes
- A linear block codes is a type of error correcting code where each code word is a block of fixed length.

- The code is linear meaning the sum of any two code words is also a code word.
