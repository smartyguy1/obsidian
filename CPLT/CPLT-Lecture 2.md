- The programming languages used in this generation are C, C++, JAVA, .NET.
- Some of most popular 5th generation computers are, desktop, laptop, notebook, chrome-book,

# Functional Units of Computer
- Input
- Output
- Memory
- Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)
- Contact Unit(CU)

*Input and Output come under I/O unit*. 
*(3)and (4) come under CPU (Central Processing Unit)*
*Information is Fed into the computer either in the from of instructions or data.*

- Instructions are explicit commands. Data is a collection of information gathered by observations.
- Program is a set of information that perform  a task that is stored in the memory.

# Input Devices
The devices that are used to give data and instructions to the computer are called input devices.
1. **Keyboard**: It is used to enter data and instructions directly into the computer.
2. **Mouse**: It is basically a pointing device which on the principle of point and click.
	- *Optical Mouse*: It uses red light to track the movement of mouse for moving the pointer on the computer screen.
	- *Cordless Mouse*: It does not have wires, It either uses Bluetooth technology to send the data through the air to the receiver.
3. **Light-pen**:  A pen shaped device which can be used by directly pointing the objects on the screen. It can also be used for drawing.
 4. **Touchscreen**: A special computer screen that takes the input by sensing the touch of human finger, pen. or any other pointing device.
 5. **Scanner**: we can store pictures, photos, diagrams into the computer with the help of a scanner.
