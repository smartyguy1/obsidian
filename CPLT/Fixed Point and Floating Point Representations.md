Real numbers can be represented in computer in two ways
1. Fixed Point
2. Floating Point

# Fixed
In this method the decimal point is placed in a fixed place.
- Numbers ending with a decimal point are called Whole Numbers
- Numbers Starting with a decimal point are called fractions
It is suitable in applications needing consistent precision like financial calculations
Ex:
$$
\begin{align*}
45.0 \rightarrow \text{Whole numbers}\\
0.45 \rightarrow \text{Fraction}\\
\end{align*}
$$

# Floating
In this method, the position of the decimal point is not specified. By this a number can be expressed in different ways. Eg:
$$
\begin{align*}
(2324)_{10} \\
12.234
\end{align*}
$$
It is suitable for scientific calculation requiring a wide range if values. 

# ASCII
It stands for **American Standard Code for Information Interchange.**
- It is a 7 bit character code representing text in computers.
- It defines 128 characters( letters, digits, punctuation marks and control characters).
- For Eg: ASCII value of `A` is `65` while for `a` is `97`.
# EBCDIC
It stands for **Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code**. 
- It is an 8-bit character code used mainly on **IBM mainframes**
- It defines 256 characters including letters, digits and control characters.
- For eg: `A` --> `193`, `a`-->`129`.
# Practical Applications and examples
#### Binary and Hexadecimals in computing
- Essential for understanding machine level operations and memory addressing.
#### Character encodings in data exchange
- ASCII for modern text data exchange.
#### EBCDIC
- For legacy system compatibility.
