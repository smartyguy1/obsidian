# Algorithm

Algorithm is a well defined set of instructions to solve a particular problem. It is a step-by-step solution of a problem where each step performs a specific operation.
## Algorithm to add two numbers
- **Step 1:** Start
- **Step 2:** Declare variables (to store value)
- **Step 3:** Assign Variables with values
- **Step 4:** Add both variables by using the statement `sum = A+B`
- **Step 5:** Return `sum`
- **Step 6:** Stop

## Write an Algorithm to calculate the area of a circle
- **Step 1:** Start
- **Step 2:** Declare variable (to store value)
- **Step 3:** Assign Variable with values
- **Step 4:** Find area using the statement `area = 3.14*r*r`
- **Step 5:** Return `area`
- **Step 6:** Stop
## To print the area of rectangle
- **Step 1:** Start
- **Step 2:** Declare variable (to store value
- **Step 3:** Assign Variable with values
- **Step 4:** Find area using the statement `area = l*b`
- **Step 5:** Return `area`
- **Step 6:** Stop
### *Write an algorithm to find largest among three numbers*
- **Step 1:** Start
- **Step 2:** Declare variable (`a, b, c`)
- **Step 3:** Assign Variable with values
- **Step 4:** Declare variable (`largest`)
- **Step 5:** Assign largest to `a`
- **Step 6:** Compare `largest` with `b` 
- **Step 7:** If `b` > `largest`, then assign `largest = b`
- **Step 8:** Compare `largest` with `c` 
- **Step 9:** If `c` > `largest`, then assign `largest = c`
- **Step 10:** Return `largest`
- **Step 11:** Stop

## Characteristics of an Algorithm
![[CPLT-10.1.excalidraw]]
### Input:
An Algorithm should have zero or more well defined inputs. These inputs are the data required to perform a task. 
#### Output
An algorithm should have at least one well defined output. The output is the expected result after the algorithm has processed the input.

#### Finiteness
An algorithm must always terminate after a finite number of steps. It should not go into an infinite loop. Each step in an algorithm must be clear and straight forward.

#### Effectiveness
The operations must be feasible and directly executable. 

# Flowchart
A flow chart is a visual representation of the sequence of steps and decisions needed to perform a process.

We use different symbols for this purpose:
- Oval (Terminator)
- Rectangle (Process)
- Parallelogram (Input/Output)
- Diamond (Decision)
- Circle (Connector for different segments)
- Arrow Lines (Flow of
