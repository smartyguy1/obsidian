# Fundamentals of Programming

## Basic Elements of a Program:
A program consists of many small individual elements. Each elements has a specific meaning for the compiler. 
1. **Syntax** 
2. **Tokens**
3. **Variables**
4. **Comment Line**
5. **Header Files**
6. **Coding Environment( IDE, Editor, etc.)**

## Program Design Life Cycle

### Problem Definition: 
This is the first phase of PDLC, in which problem is defined.
- What is the objective of the problems?
- What will be the inputs for the problem?
- What will be the output?
- Is it Feasible or not?
### Program Design:
This is the second phase of PDLC, where outline of a program is designed to solve the problem.(Defined in the first phase.)
A programmer determines the best suitable technique to solve the problem. Some are:
1. Procedural (Top-Down approach)
2. OOPS (Bottom-up approach)
3. Structured 
4. Functional

### Coding
Coding is the implementation phase in which syntax of a programming language is used to write the instructions to solve the problem. 

### Testing and Debugging
After coding it is desirable to achieve the objective of the problem. Testing is the process to check whether all objectives are achieved or not. Many different sets of testing data are provided to program as inputs to check the errors and bugs.

Debugging is the process of correcting and fixing errors and bugs that occur in a program.
### Maintenance 
This is the last phase of program design life-cycle. In this phase, an existing program is maintained as per new technologies and the needs of users.
