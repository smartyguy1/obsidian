*Avashalon Elitzur* and *Lev Vaidman* imagined a bomb with a special type of trigger: a photon detector. A narrow tube goes across each bomb and in the middle of  the tube there is a photon detector. To detonate the bomb one sends a photon into the tube. The photon in then detected by the photon detector and the bomb explodes.
If the photon detector is defective, however, the photon is not detected at all. It propagates freely though the tube and comes out of the bomb. The bomb does not explode.

If we want to have a number of Elitzur-Vaidman (EV) bombs, but we know that some of them are defective, How could we tell if a bomb is operational without detonating it. Assume for the sake of the problem, that we are unable to examine the detector without destroying the bomb.

If we send a photon into the detector tube and nothing happens we know the bomb is defective. If it is not defective it explodes, which makes it useless. So it seems impossible to find a functional bomb without destroying it. It seems impossible in *Classical Physics*. It is not impossible in quantum mechanics, however.

We now place an EV bomb on the lower path of an Interferometer, with the detector tube properly aligned. Suppose we send in a photon as pictured. If the bomb is defective, it will seem as if there is no detector,(so the photon beams travels freely through it and will end up in D0).

| Outcome                     | $P$ |
| --------------------------- | --- |
| Photon at D0(No explosion)  | 1   |
| Photon at D1 (No explosion) | 0   |
| Bomb explodes               | 0   |
On the other hand, if the bomb is working, we have the situation as given in the following figure, as seen in [[Mach-Zehder Interferometer|Previous lecture]]
![[Pasted image 20240809082724.png]]And the result is :

| Outcome                     | $P$   |
| --------------------------- | ----- |
| Bomb explodes               | $1/2$ |
| Photon at D0 (no explosion) | $1/4$ |
| Photon at D1 (no explosion) | $1/4$ |
assuming the bomb is working. Then $50\%$ of the times the photon will hit it and it will explode, $25\%$ of time time the photon will end in D0 and we can't tell if it is defective or not. But $25\%$ of the time the photon will end in D1, and since this was impossible for a faulty bomb, we have learned that the bomb is operational.
