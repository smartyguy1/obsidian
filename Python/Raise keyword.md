In Python, the `raise` statement is used to **manually trigger an [[Files and Exceptions|exception]]**. It allows you to interrupt the normal flow of your program and indicate that something went wrong. You can use `raise` with or without specifying a particular exception.

### Basic Syntax

```python
raise ExceptionType("Error message")
```

### Examples

1. **Raising a Generic Exception**
    
    ```python
    raise Exception("Something went wrong!")
    ```
    
    This will immediately terminate the program and print:
    
    ```
    Exception: Something went wrong!
    ```
    
2. **Raising a Specific Exception**
    
    ```python
    raise ValueError("Invalid value provided!")
    ```
    
    Output:
    
    ```
    ValueError: Invalid value provided!
    ```
    
3. **Re-Raising an Exception** You can also use `raise` without any arguments inside an `except` block to re-raise the caught exception.
    
    ```python
    try:
        x = 1 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError:
        print("Caught a division by zero error!")
        raise
    ```
    
    Output:
    
    ```
    Caught a division by zero error!
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
    ```
    
4. **Custom Exceptions** You can define your own exceptions by inheriting from the `Exception` class.
    
    ```python
    class MyCustomError(Exception):
        pass
    
    raise MyCustomError("This is a custom error!")
    ```
    
    Output:
    
    ```
    __main__.MyCustomError: This is a custom error!
    ```
    

### Why Use `raise`?

- To **signal an error condition** that your program has detected.
- To **re-raise an exception** after catching it for logging or cleanup.
- To **create and raise custom exceptions** for specific error conditions.
