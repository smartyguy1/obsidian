# Abstract
Online whiteboards have emerged as valuable tools for remote collaboration and education. These platforms offer real-time interaction, visual creation, and idea generation capabilities (Gupta & Bahl, 2021; Li et al., 2021). They support various activities, including teaching, meetings, and collaborative design projects (Gupta & Bahl, 2021; Zaqoot & Lih-Bin, 2018). However, there do not exit many such online whiteboards that only allow remote collaboration but also include features such as version control, multi-user access, ability to be saved locally and exported to other applications. The proposed web-application seeks to address the above mentioned lack of features.
