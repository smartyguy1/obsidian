A virtual function is a member function that is declared within a base [[C++ OOPs|class]] and is re-defined by a derived class. When you refer to a derived class object using a [[Pointers|pointer]] or a reference to the base class, you can call a virtual function for that object and execute the derived class's version of the method. 

- Virtual functions ensure that the correct function is called for an object, regardless of the type of reference (or pointer) used for the function call.
- They are mainly used to achieve Runtime [[C++ OOPs#^049e21|polymorphism]].
- Functions are declared with a virtual keyword in a base class.
- The resolving of a function call is done at runtime.

# Rules

1. Virtual functions cannot be [[Static Data Members|static]] 
2. A virtual function can be a friend function of another class
3. Virtual functions should be accessed using a pointer or reference of base class type to achieve runtime polymorphism.
4. The prototype of virtual functions should be the same in the base as well as the derived class.
5. They are always defines in the base class and overridden in a derived class. It is not mandatory for the derived class to override (or re-define the virtual function), in that case, the base class version of the function is used.
6. A class may have a virtual destructor but it cannot have a virtual constructor.

# Pure Virtual Function

Sometimes the base class can **declare** that a function exists, but has **no sensible way to implement it**. Instead, every derived class _must_ provide its own version.  
Thatâ€™s a **pure virtual function**. 

```c++
// C++ program to illustrate
// concept of Virtual Functions

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

class base {
public:
    virtual void print() { cout << "print base class\n"; }
    void show() { cout << "show base class\n"; }
};

class derived : public base {
public:
    void print() override { cout << "print derived class\n"; }
    void show() { cout << "show derived class\n"; }
};

int main()
{
    base* bptr;
    derived d;
    bptr = &d;
    // Virtual function, binded at runtime
    bptr->print();
    // Non-virtual function, binded at compile time
    bptr->show();
    return 0;
}
```

Output:
```
print derived class
show base class
```
