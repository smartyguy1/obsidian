As a programmer just because a program [[Compiling Process in C|compiles]] does not mean it has no errors. The unintended or undesired outputs/faults/processes are called **bugs** in our program.

VScode has a built-in GUI for debugging which makes it easier to debug programs

# How to debug?

First set a breakpoint. This will be the point where you want the function to pause mid-way, so you can analyse, variable values, function calls etc.
This can be done by clicking behind the line number on the left side of vscode code environment.

Then click debug. You can then *step-over*, *step-out*, or *step-in*.
