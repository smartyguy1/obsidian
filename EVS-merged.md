# What is Environtment?
THe literal meaning of the word is "Surrounding". Everything around us constitutes the *Environment*(Biotic or Abiotic)

## Biotic:
Living creatures.(eg: Humans, Dogs, other animals)
## Abiotic: 
Non-Living things(eg: Rock, wind, etc.)

# Unit-1: Multi-disciplinary nature of environmental studies
## Environment:
Its a derivative of a french word "*Environner*" meaning Surrounding. The components of our Surrounding are:
### Two components:
1. **Biotic**: Living(eg: humans, animals. plants)
2. **Abiotic**: Non-Living(eg: rocks, air etc.)

# Lecture 3





# Atmosphere
- Mix of gases ($N_{2}$, $CO_{2}$, $CO$, $SO_{x}$, $NO_{x} \ \dots$) + Dust particles + Water-Droplets+ Subatomic Particles
- It is an abiotic component.

It is the mixture of various gases, water-vapors, and subatomic particles that entirely covers the earth, extending outward several thousand kilometers.

## Layers of Atmosphere: 

![[EVS-L4.1.excalidraw]]

### Troposphere
- Lower portion of the atmosphere
- Extends up to 8 Km at the poles and 16 km at the equator, on an average it extends up to 10-11 Km form the Earth's surface.
- Temperature decreases at the rate of 5-7$\degree \text{C}$ per Km. 
### Stratosphere
- 2nd layer of Atmosphere. Lies above the Troposphere.
- 50-55 Km above the Earth's Surface
- Ozone layer exists in in the Stratosphere.
- Temperature remains constant for 20Km, then starts increasing

### Mesosphere
- 3rd layer of the Atmosphere 
- Lies at 80 Km above the Earth's Surface.
- Temperature $\downarrow$es slightly, then rapidly with height (-75$\degree C$) 
### Thermosphere
- Temperature increases rapidly with increase on height
- Heating of this layer is due to the absorption of solar energy.
- Within the thermosphere there is a layer of charged particles known as **ionosphere**.

### Exosphere
- It exists above the ionosphere and extends up to 2000Km above the Earth's Surface.
- This layer is almost a vacuum.
- Very high temperature. ($\geq12000\degree C$ )

# Importance of Environmental Studies

For the survival of present and future generations, environmental education is important. 
The important benefits of environmental studies are the following
1. It directs attention towards the unlimited exploitation of the environment
2. It generates concern for the changing environment and population explosion.
3. It helps to understand different food chains and to find ways to maintain ecological balance.
4. It helps in the maintenance of a healthy life.
5. It imparts knowledge about the conservation of energy and reducing material dependency.
	- By refusing to purchase things that are harmful to the environment.
	- By reusing a product a number of times.
	- By motivating the recycling of products. 
	- **R's**: **R**euse, **R**ecycle and **R**educe.
# Need for Public Awareness

We are responsible for depletion of natural resources, degradation of life supporting systems, Ecological imbalance, Polluted environment etc. Solid waste management, Oil pollution, Water pollution, air pollution, Smog, Bhopal Gas Tragedy, *Itai-Itai* Disease, Minamata Bay etc. are examples that threaten our survival. To get rid of these problems, environmental awareness is necessary. 
To protect the Environment, we should do the following,
1.  Preserve Forest Cover: We should minimize cutting of trees, 
2. Preserve Natural Resources
	1. We should not unnecessarily extract natural resources, such as Mineral resources, water resources etc.
3. Conserve Energy: We should not use too much energy from burning of fossil fuels.
4. Practice Green Technology: Use green technology that incorporates:
	- Treatment of aerial emissions.
	- Treatment of waste water
	- Waste reduction
	- Use of unconventional energy resources.
5. Maintain Ecological balance

Itai-Itai DIsease: too much cadmium 
Minamata Bay: too much Mercury

# Forest Resources
![[EVS-5.2.excalidraw|600]]


### Deforestation
In 1900 there 7000 million hectare was covered by forests, in 1975 it was down to 2800 million hectare, This drastic change was brought on by the Industrial Revolution and the rapid industrialization that followed it. By the year 2000, it was 2350 million hectare of forest land.

#### Causes:
1. Shifting Cultivation
2. Fuel Requirement
3. Development Projects
4. Raw Material
5. Food needs
6. Forest Fires
#### Consequences of Deforestation
1. Threatens the existence of wild life
2. Disturbs Hydrological Cycle
3. Biodiversity is lost
4. Global Warming
5. Soil Erosion


# Lecture 6


# Water Resources

97% of Earth's Surface area is covered  by water bodies.
### Characteristics
1. It exists in liquid form in the temperature range $0\degree$ - $100\degree$.
2. It is a good solvent (including $O_2$, $CO_2$ )
3. High Specific Heat
4. Ability to expand in Ice form
#### Ground water:-
It can be extracted through tube wells, handpumps and wells.

### Effects of Excess usage of Ground water:-
1. Decrease in Water Table
2. Droughts
3. Soil Fertility is lost
### Dams:-

#### Advantages:
- It is used for producing electricity 
- It Produces Electricity
- It allows us to generate Electricity without depending on non-renewable resources.
- It allows us to regulate river water flow
- I generates Jobs for people
- It allows us to flow water into areas hit with drought
