Classification is the task of predicting which of a set of classes(categories) an example belongs to--For example, a classification model for spam detection would predict "spam" or "not spam".

## Classification v/s Regression
Even though classification and regression are both from the category of supervised learning, they are not the same.
- The prediction task is a _**classification**_ when the target variable is discrete. An application is the identification of the underlying sentiment of a piece of text.

- The prediction task is a _**regression**_ when the target variable is continuous. An example can be the prediction of the salary of a person given their education degree, previous work experience, geographical location, and level of seniority.
